# Matt Owens Portfolio

## Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website for Matt Owens, showcasing his experience, skills, and projects in the field of Business Analysis and Data Analytics.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Development Process

This project marks my first experience using Cursor and its AI composer feature. I intentionally chose to use these tools to test their capabilities and explore a new development workflow.

### Cursor and AI Composer

[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) is an AI-powered code editor that aims to enhance the coding experience. Its AI composer feature assists in writing, editing, and refactoring code.

My experience with Cursor and the AI composer was:

1. **Efficient Code Generation**: The AI composer helped generate initial HTML structure and CSS styles, saving time in the setup phase.

2. **Interactive Development**: I could describe changes or additions I wanted, and the AI would suggest code snippets or modifications.

3. **Learning Opportunity**: Using the AI composer exposed me to different coding patterns and practices, enhancing my learning experience.

4. **Iterative Refinement**: The ability to quickly generate and modify code allowed for rapid prototyping and iterative improvements.

5. **Challenges**: While the AI was helpful, it sometimes required careful review and correction of its suggestions, especially for more complex or specific requirements.

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed project descriptions and live demos
- Implement a contact form
- Enhance responsive design for better mobile experience
- Integrate a blog section to share insights and experiences

## Conclusion

This project served as both a portfolio development exercise and an exploration of AI-assisted coding tools. While Cursor and its AI composer proved to be valuable assets, they also highlighted the continued importance of human oversight and decision-making in the development process.
